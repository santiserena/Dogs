## About

This platform is the result of my individual project at the Henry bootcamp. Its functionality is to see, reed, search, filter and order different breeds of dogs in different pages. The data is consumed from an external API. It also gives the possibility of creating new races, as well as eliminating them.


## Tools and technologies used
#### Front End:
- JavaScripts, React, Redux, CSS, HTML


#### Back End:
- Node Js, Express, Sequelize, Postgres
